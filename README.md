# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Module 13

 An earthquake map was created with two different maps and the earthquake overlay for a project.Additionally, the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 was added on the map, and alternate view on a third map of .


This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables. 
They are the following the following:

## Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
